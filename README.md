Welcome to the Big Data Lab of PolyU CPCE, a hub for cutting-edge research in large language models (LLMs). Our lab specializes in developing advanced techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multimodal LLMs, sparse language models (SLMs), and optimizing LLMs for mobile devices, pushing forward the capabilities of AI in understanding and generating human-like text.

üîç **Current Focus Areas:**
- Development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhancing information retrieval.
- Research on Multimodal LLMs to integrate and interpret multiple forms of data.
- Innovation in Small Language Models (SLMs) for efficient processing.
- Optimizing LLM performance on mobile devices for on-the-go AI applications.
